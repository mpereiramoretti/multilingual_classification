# Multilingual classification

Project for the discipline PSI5123 - Aprendizagem de Máquina para Sinais de Áudio e Voz, which consists of classifying audio texts into a set of languages using audio characteristics.

## Databases

For this project, we're going to use the Mozilla Common Voices database (available at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets), which consists of short MP3 file recordings in different languages.

For the sake of simplicity, we're going to consider only 4 languages for classification: French, German, Italian and Chinese.

We downloaded the following files, with the following volumes:

- French: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (~2 GB, 1.697 voices)
- German: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (~4 GB, 2.249 voices)
- Italian: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (531 MB, 313 voices)
- Chinese (China): Common Voice Corpus 2.0 (345 MB, 289 voices)
