# Multilingual classification

Project for the discipline PSI5123 - Aprendizagem de Máquina para Sinais de Áudio e Voz, which consists of classifying audio texts into a set of languages using audio characteristics.

## Databases

For this project, we're going to use the Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) database (available at https://www.openslr.org/94/), which consists of short FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) file recordings in different languages. This format represents compressed audio  files without losing information, being a similar representation when compared to WAV files.

For the sake of simplicity, we're going to consider only 4 languages for classification: Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

We downloaded the following files, with the following volumes:

- Italian: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (50 GB, 1.697 voices)
- Polish: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (15 GB, 2.249 voices)
- Portuguese: Common Voice Corpus 1.0 (9.3 GB, 313 voices)
- Spanish: Common Voice Corpus 2.0 (2.6 GB, 289 voices)
